# Data manipulation

# in python we have operators, that
# allow us to change data

# assigment operaterors 

# comparison operateors

# logical operateror

# Arithamtic operater

10<20 # is 10 less than 20 
20.34 > = 0 # is 20.34 greater than or equal to 0 
100 == 100 # is 100 the same as 100 
100 != 10 # is 100 not the same as 10 


# arthmatic operator allows us to peform math with - specifically with the integer and float data type


10 + 10 # addition 
12-2 # subtraction
10*3 # multiplication 
2/1 # division 

# we use logical operators
10*3=30
